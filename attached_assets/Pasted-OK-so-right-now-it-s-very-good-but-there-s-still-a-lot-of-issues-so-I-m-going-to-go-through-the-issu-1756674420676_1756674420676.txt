OK so right now it's very good but there's still a lot of issues so I'm going to go through the issues 1 by 1 OK 1st issue is that if there is no stand then it says that you need to select an airport but you have to select an airport before so it should only say That no stand is selected another issue is that the aircraft diagram does not update so what I want is I'm gonna import my own dot SVG's of the top of the aircraft and I need you to just have it so change the aircraft type checklist still don't work so please fix that also there's a custom amount of stands at each airport so give me the ability to have a file for each airport that determines how many stands they are which stands are narrow medium or wide and which stance are cargo the UI is pretty bad right now the ui definitely needs to be updated I want more like an ipad more like the A320 more like fly by wires a 320 on Microsoft Flight Sim like the ipad on that if that makes sense. Another issue is that system notifications and when people are typing in chat it goes to all airport ground frequencies when it should really only go to whatever airport it's at so for example if I'm at IRFT and someone else is at ITKO and I make a message at IRFD or I claim a stand only people at IRF should be able to see it also I also want like a queue system with like columns like low priority medium priority high priority with a timer on how long it's been for each one and like quotas and stuff checklist don't work so please fix that remove system menu like I want a whole different UI if your ground crew basically like it needs to look like a ground crew tablet basically. The biggest thing is like updated UI and fixing all the bug issues the second biggest thing is checklists make sure it puts system messages for different colors so like if they're ground if it's coming from ground like if someone on ground crew accepted a cleaning make it orange if a pilot is requesting something make it blue if someones typing make it a different color
